# myGAN-tf2.0
GAN For Generating Fake Faces Using TensorFlow 2.0
## Dataset 
I have used celeba dataset containing 2.3M (approx) images
## note:-
Dataset comes with images inside a folder,  so I have converted the images into numpy arrar (code is inside notebook),
I have resize the image to 28*28*3 so as to reduce the size of file. If you use to resize in hyper size that do take in consider the amount of memory used by the array.
## Special Thanks:-
I learn about working with raw Image dataset from www.pythonprogramming.net .
I took help from many places like towardsdatascience.com and TensorFlow 2.0 official website Tutorials
